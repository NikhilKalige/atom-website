Atom Website
============

It is currently active at [atom.shortcircuits.io](http://atom.shortcircuits.io)

I created this website so as to learn [AmpersandJS](https://ampersandjs.com/).

This tries to replicate the package manager website for [Atom](https://atom.io/packages).

The webapp runs with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the server. The frontend of the website is entirely based on AmperandJS.

The data from the atom server is used to update the website once everyday.

The production ready files are in **production** branch

The stylesheets for the website are taken from the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) website. I have included the license from npmjs repo [@LICENSE](https://github.com/NikhilKalige/atom-website/blob/master/LICENSE). I hope this satisfies the licensing issues. Please let me know if you have any issues regarding this or any other content i have utilized in the making this website. I would happily acknowledge your rights or remove it for you.
